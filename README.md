# 📊 Revenue & Customer Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **hobby project** to deepen my SQL skills, ft. Power BI. In this project, I explore the microsoft dataset **Contoso** to analyze sales revenue, customer behavior, and product performance.

**Key objectives:**

- 💰 Analyze revenue trends and product performance
- 👥 Segment customers and calculate lifetime value (LTV)
- 📊 Practice advanced SQL (cohorts, percentiles, window functions)
- 🛠️ Enhance SQL proficiency with joins, CTEs, and date-based calculations

## 📁 Project Structure

| File                               | Description                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `revenue_performance_analysis.sql` | Revenue trends, product performance, and sales metrics         |
| `customer_analysis.sql`            | Customer behavior, retention, lifetime value, and segmentation |

## 📏 Key Metrics Calculated

- Total revenue by order, product, and category 💰
- Monthly net revenue trends 📅
- Median sales per product category 📊
- Revenue tiers per product category 🔝
- Average processing time between order and delivery ⏱️
- Cohort-based customer revenue tracking 📆
- Customer lifetime value (LTV) 💎
- Customer segmentation (LOW, MID, HIGH value) 🏷️
- Active vs churned customer identification 🔄

## 📈 Key Insights

**Monthly Revenue Trends (2020–2024):**

![Revenue_yearly](/Images/Revenue.png)

- Sales in general tends to dip around **March** and **April**.

**Revenue Distribution By product Category:**

![Revenue_distribution](/Images/revenue_by_category.png)

- This visualization shows how product categories contribute to overall revenue. Categories like **Computers, TV and Video, and Cameras** are dominated by **high-revenue transactions**, making them core drivers of sales, while ategories like **Games and Toys** or **Audio** rely more on **low and medium-tier sales**, suggesting lower revenue concentration but possibly higher transaction volumes.

**Customer Segmentation: Total Life Time Value:**

![Customer_segmentation](/Images/customer_segmentation.png)

- Shows that the sales are relying mostly on high value customers, customer that spend the most

**Active customers in the last 6 months:**

![Customer_status](/Images/customer_activation.png)

- Shows the percentage of active customer while **excluding new customers** from the last 6 months to avoid inflating activity rates. This helps distinguish truly active customers from recent first-time buyers.

## 🧑‍💻 Skills Showcased

Through this project, I was able to practice and demonstrate a wide range of SQL and data analysis skills, including:

- **Data Extraction & Transformation** 🔍

  - Writing complex `SELECT` statements with joins across multiple tables (`sales`, `customer`, `product`).
  - Applying filters, aggregations, and calculations to derive business metrics.

- **Analytical SQL Techniques** 📊

  - Using **window functions** (`OVER`, `PARTITION BY`, `PERCENTILE_CONT`) for cohort analysis, lifetime value (LTV), and median/percentile calculations.
  - Creating **CTEs** (Common Table Expressions) to structure multi-step queries for readability and reusability.
  - Performing **date-based calculations** (extracting year/month, using `AGE`, handling intervals).

- **Segmentation & Distribution Analysis** 🏷️

  - Customer segmentation based on lifetime value (low, mid, high tiers).
  - Revenue segmentation by category and revenue tier (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH).
  - Active vs churned customer classification with conditional logic.

- **Business-Oriented Insights** 💡

  - Identifying revenue concentration in high-value customers.
  - Analyzing seasonal sales dips and trends across months/years.
  - Understanding customer retention through cohort and activity analysis.

- **Data Visualization Integration** 📈
  - Designing and embedding visuals (bar charts, revenue trends, segmentation distributions) to communicate findings effectively.
  - Connecting SQL query outputs to visualization tools Power BI.
